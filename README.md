# recursion

#task 1
(I) Using iteration, write a function fibs which takes a number and returns an array containing that many numbers from the fibonacci sequence. Using an example input of 8, this function should return the array [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13].
(II) write another function fibsRec which solves the same problem recursively

#task 2
Build a function mergeSort that takes in an array and returns a sorted array, using a recursive merge sort methodology.
